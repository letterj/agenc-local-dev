## [Unreleased]

### Security
- **Exposed API key remediation (2026-04-02):** `docker/creator/config.json` and
  `docker/worker/config.json` were present in git history (commit `c5455a0`) with a real
  xAI API key. GitHub push protection blocked the push. Key rotated, both files expunged
  from all 45 commits via `git filter-repo --invert-paths`, history force-pushed clean.
  GitHub secret scanning shows 0 open alerts post-push. Prevention notes added to
  `docs/RUNBOOK.md` under new "Security Incidents" section.

### Docs
- `docker-compose.yml` (root) — replaced legacy `agenc-operator` single-service definition
  with dual `agenc-creator` (port 3100) and `agenc-worker` (port 3101) services. Root compose
  is now canonical; `docker compose up -d` from `agenc-local-dev/` starts both containers.
  Volume names: `agenc-local-dev_agenc-creator-data`, `agenc-local-dev_agenc-worker-data`.
  Config bind-mounts from `./docker/creator/config.json` and `./docker/worker/config.json`.
- `scripts/devnet-task-lifecycle.mjs` — updated hardcoded agent PDAs from stale V1-era values
  (`GvXS49…` creator, `CmehT9…` worker) to current V2 PDAs (`HmZqAsDz…`, `DQ1drYVZ…`).
  Root cause: PDAs were set at initial script creation and never updated after the V2 re-registration.
- `CLAUDE.md` — retired "Operator Instance (Docker)" section; replaced with "Docker Containers"
  table listing `agenc-creator` and `agenc-worker` with ports, wallets, and config paths.
  Updated Quick Reference line to reference dual-container setup.
- `README.md` — replaced all `docker exec agenc-operator` commands with `agenc-creator`.
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — updated daily ops commands from `agenc-operator` to `agenc-creator`/
  `agenc-worker`; updated dual-container start path from `docker/` subdir to root; added
  retirement note for `agenc-operator`.
- `docs/HOW-TO/HOW-TO-DUAL-DOCKER.md` — updated directory layout note, start/stop commands
  now reference root compose instead of `docker/` subdir; updated port conflict section.
- `skills/agenc-morning-sync/SKILL.md` — Step 6 updated to check `agenc-creator` and
  `agenc-worker` independently and start via root `docker compose up -d`; summary block
  updated to show both containers.
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — dual-agent task lifecycle run (2026-04-02): full create→claim→complete
  confirmed against V2 program (`GN69C…`) with both containers live (creator port 3100, worker
  port 3101). Task PDA `2FVqsj…`, all three txs confirmed on devnet. Worker container was
  down at start — started via `docker compose up -d agenc-worker`.
  Fix: `scripts/devnet-task-lifecycle.mjs` had stale V1-era agent PDAs hardcoded (`GvXS49…`
  creator, `CmehT9…` worker); updated to V2 PDAs (`HmZqAsDz…`, `DQ1drYVZ…`) before running.
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — added creator agent confirmation entry (2026-04-02): queried
  `HmZqAsDzW1Ew6SwQCcZoBvzYaYRXs2TeXBx31s8xSy7H` via `getAgent()` with V2 IDL;
  account is active against `GN69C…` (V2 program), authority `BP3rDM…` (creator wallet),
  capabilities=1, status=1, stakeAmount=1,000,000 lamports, activeTasks=0, reputation=5000.
  Creator container confirmed healthy (HTTP 200, port 3100), wallet balance 33.36 SOL.
  No fresh registration was needed.
- `docs/PROJECT-PLAN.md` — updated task statuses as of 2026-04-02: Tasks 1–3, 6–8 confirmed
  done; Task 4 (TASKS UI bug) now reflects PR #43 open awaiting re-review from Pavelevich;
  Task 5 closed as n/a (too minor, low upstream value); Tasks 9–10 marked on hold /
  blocked pending dev team response on token usage logging. Added **Future PR Opportunities**
  section cataloguing the stale `PROGRAM_ID` V1 constant in `agenc-sdk/src/constants.ts`
  and downstream references in `agenc-core/mcp/src/server.ts`, soak scripts, and
  `bootstrap-cli.ts` — not blocking today but candidate for upstream PR when team has
  bandwidth.
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — added Known Issue #5: Pack Smoke CI failure due to PostCSS native
  binding missing in CI runner (`public-install-min-node` + `private-kernel-registry` checks);
  root cause is npm optional deps bug [npm/cli#4828](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828),
  pre-existing on upstream `main` as of 2026-04-02, not PR-specific
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — expanded Protocol Config PDA entry with full root cause analysis
  (2026-04-02): seed is `"protocol"` (single word); V2 program `GN69C…` + seed →
  `GEXnAns2…` ✓; `agenc-sdk/src/constants.ts` `PROGRAM_ID` constant is still the V1
  program (`6UcJzb…`) so any `deriveProtocolPda()` call without an explicit `programId`
  arg derives the wrong PDA; local devnet scripts are safe (build Program object from IDL,
  pass `program.programId` explicitly); upstream stale V1 references catalogued in
  agenc-core MCP server, soak scripts, and bootstrap-cli

### Verified
- **Dual-agent task lifecycle — V2 devnet — 2026-04-02:** full create → claim → complete
  confirmed against program `GN69CoBM1XUt8MJtA6Kwd7WRwLzTNtVqLwf5o3fwWDV3` (Task Validation V2)
  using both containers running from root `docker-compose.yml`.
  Creator (`agenc-creator`, port 3100, wallet `BP3rDM…`) created task;
  worker (`agenc-worker`, port 3101, wallet `26d6kx…`) claimed and completed it.
  Task PDA: `2FVqsjXojtpsJ1tYpD22dkhyAV76XjKCpSfNxgFVRVBm`. Reward: 0.01 SOL.
  Final state: Completed at 2026-04-02T23:03:23Z.
  Solscan txs: create `2REHbJQ…`, claim `z9Zr2Aj…`, complete `4PDbvrc…`.

### Fixed
- `scripts/devnet-task-lifecycle.mjs` — corrected stale V1-era agent PDAs hardcoded at script
  creation (`GvXS49pWYMtgThmeVw32L7dPBFyCD1siYsTH4CaobpEs` creator, `CmehT9UrmeCEFNKuXKVHuoQuAjZAa6J6sgC1W8gRr58V`
  worker). Updated to V2 PDAs (`HmZqAsDzW1Ew6SwQCcZoBvzYaYRXs2TeXBx31s8xSy7H` creator,
  `DQ1drYVZ9WuHANrnBBLWiaHm9vifZ2p4y7HZ4EFiNDdv` worker). Script was failing with
  `AccountNotInitialized` on `creator_agent` because the old PDA no longer exists under
  the V2 program.
- `heartbeat.enabled: false` added to all container configs and Dockerfile injection
  to stop idle LLM token burn. The runtime's heartbeat scheduler defaults to
  **enabled** when no `heartbeat` key is present in config — firing grok-3 requests
  every 5 minutes (2 meta-planner actions per fire) plus a `self-learning` cron
  every 6 hours and a `curiosity` cron every 2 hours, all with no user activity.
  Over ~7 days continuous this burned ~$50 in xAI tokens. The single config key
  `"heartbeat": { "enabled": false }` gates the entire autonomous features block.
  Applied to: `docker/creator/config.json`, `docker/creator/config.json.example`,
  `docker/worker/config.json`, `docker/worker/config.json.example`, and the
  `agenc-start.sh` injection script in `Dockerfile`.

### Added
- `agenc-morning-sync` skill — codifies the session-start workflow as a reusable Claude skill:
  fetches upstream changes across all AgenC repos, syncs forks that have new commits,
  checks PR status, and starts the Docker operator container
- `agenc-morning-sync` skill now checks the tetsuo-ai GitHub org for new repositories
  created since the previous session; flags anything matching `agenc-marketplace` or other
  extracted-component naming patterns against the known six-repo list
- `agenc-morning-sync` skill: Step 3b — npm release check for `@tetsuo-ai/agenc`;
  compares `dist-tags.latest` against baseline `0.1.0` (published 2026-03-19);
  prints a single-line status in the sync summary; alerts with release date and
  image rebuild prompt when a newer version is available — prevents rebuilding the
  Docker image when tetsuo-ai has not yet published
- `agenc-morning-sync` skill now includes Step 5b: rebuild `forks/agenc-sdk` dist if
  any agenc-sdk commits landed during sync (dist/ is gitignored; stale dist causes BN
  errors in devnet scripts)
- `scripts/devnet-task-lifecycle.mjs` — full create→claim→complete task lifecycle on
  devnet using separate creator (`id.json`) and worker (`worker.json`) wallets; confirmed
  working 2026-03-24 (create `4q2d3zL…`, claim `3RwRUqC…`, complete `3FCrfT8…`)
- `package.json` — declares `@tetsuo-ai/sdk` (file path), `@coral-xyz/anchor`, and
  `@solana/web3.js` as explicit deps to ensure a single hoisted anchor instance and
  avoid the BN dual-instance error
- `docs/HOW-TO-TASK-LIFECYCLE.md` — full walkthrough for devnet task lifecycle including
  pre-flight checklist, cost breakdown, recovery paths, and verified Solscan links
- `README.md` — added Skills and Scripts sections, scripts/ to Contents table,
  and Prerequisites — Devnet Wallets table to Requirements
- `docs/PROJECT-PLAN.md` — 10-task contributor roadmap across 4 tracks:
  Infrastructure, Upstream Contributions, Protocol (on-chain work), and
  Observability; includes dependency graph and suggested execution order
- `forks/agenc-core` branch `fix/task-ownership-ui` pushed — scopes `[CANCEL TASK]`
  and `[CLAIM TASK]` buttons to wallet ownership: cancel only shows for task creator,
  claim only shows for non-creator; `agentWallet` prop threaded from
  `walletInfo.wallet?.address` through `MarketplaceView → TasksPane → TasksView → TaskCard`;
  safe default (neither button renders) when wallet not yet loaded — closes tetsuo-ai/agenc-core#32
- `agenc-core/web` dev server setup documented: build `@tetsuo-ai/desktop-tool-contracts`
  then `@tetsuo-ai/runtime` to produce `dist/browser.mjs`; start with
  `npm run dev` in `web/`; point at live container via `?ws=ws://localhost:3100`
  query param (no proxy config needed — `useWebSocket` reads `ws` from query string)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-21

### Investigation: gateway.bind + Docker bridge IP

The initial `[0.1.0]` setup used `gateway.bind: "0.0.0.0"` (daemon binds all
interfaces) with `AUTH_SECRET` (required by the runtime for non-loopback binding).
This session investigated the TRACE tab returning `Authentication required` and
arrived at a different architecture.

**Root cause discovered:** `auth.localBypass: true` only fires when the
connection `remoteAddress` is exactly `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or
`::ffff:127.0.0.1`. When a browser connects to `localhost:3100` on the Mac
host, Docker translates via the bridge network and the daemon sees the
connection from the bridge gateway IP (e.g. `192.168.97.1`), not loopback.
This means `localBypass: true` cannot authenticate browser connections through
Docker port mapping on macOS — regardless of the config.

**Structural constraint:** The runtime enforces `auth.secret is required when
gateway.bind is non-local`. This creates an unavoidable incompatibility:
`bind: "0.0.0.0"` requires `auth.secret`; `auth.secret` breaks browser UI via
Docker port mapping on macOS; `bind: "127.0.0.1"` makes the daemon unreachable
through Docker port mapping without an additional bridge.

### Fixed

- Restored socat bridge: daemon binds to `127.0.0.1:3100` (no `auth.secret`
  required); socat listens on `0.0.0.0:3101` and forwards to `127.0.0.1:3100`;
  docker-compose maps `host:3100 → container:3101`
- Removed `auth.secret` and `AUTH_SECRET` from config injection entirely —
  the socat architecture makes auth.secret unnecessary for local dev
- Docker port mapping corrected: `3100:3101` (container socat port, not daemon port)
- TRACE tab (`observability.traces`) now works in browser without authentication errors
- `socat` added back to apt-get install in Dockerfile

### Changed

- Config injection: `cfg.gateway = { port: ... }` (no bind, no auth) +
  `delete cfg.auth` to clear any residual auth config from the volume
- `AUTH_SECRET` env var removed from docker-compose.yml and .env.example
  (still present in compose environment block but unused; can be removed)

### Documentation

- PR #27 on `tetsuo-ai/agenc-core` updated with two-scenario Gateway Config
  documentation: Scenario 1 (browser UI via Docker, no auth.secret) and
  Scenario 2 (CLI-only via docker exec, with auth.secret + localBypass) —
  includes explicit note about Docker bridge IP limitation

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-21

### Added
- `docker-compose.yml` for container orchestration with named volume persistence
- `.env.example` with `GROK_API_KEY`, `AGENT_NAME`, and `AUTH_SECRET` fields
- `agenc-start.sh` entrypoint script — auto-onboards, injects config from env, rebuilds `better-sqlite3`, starts daemon
- `docs/` directory — runbook moved here from repo root
- `skills/agenc-changelog-docs-update/SKILL.md` — skill for updating changelog and docs from git commits
- `AUTH_SECRET` environment variable — required by runtime when `gateway.bind` is non-loopback

### Fixed
- `gateway.host` replaced with correct `gateway.bind` field in `agenc-start.sh` — `gateway.host` is silently ignored by the runtime (`GatewayBindConfig` interface uses `bind`, not `host`)
- Daemon now binds directly to `0.0.0.0:3100` — socat TCP port forward workaround removed
- `EXPOSE` port corrected from `3101` to `3100`
- Docker port mapping updated from `3100:3101` to `3100:3100`

### Changed
- Dockerfile `CMD` changed from `["bash"]` to `["/usr/local/bin/agenc-start.sh"]` — container now starts daemon automatically on `docker compose up -d`
- `socat` removed from apt-get install and startup script — no longer needed
- Config injection now sets `gateway.bind: "0.0.0.0"` and `auth.secret` from `AUTH_SECRET` env var

### Documentation
- Added README with requirements table, quick start, daily operations, troubleshooting, and known issues
- Added full runbook at `docs/RUNBOOK.md` with contributor workspace setup
- Documented `gateway.bind` vs `gateway.host` distinction and `auth.secret` requirement
